    "## 1. CSS Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS syntax follows a simple structure consisting of selectors and declaration blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selectors**: These are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style. You can select elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  h1 {\n",
    "    color: blue;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this example, `h1` is the selector, targeting all `<h1>` elements, and `color: blue;` is a declaration block that sets the text color of those elements to blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Declaration Blocks**: These are enclosed within curly braces `{}` and contain one or more declarations separated by semicolons `;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  selector {\n",
    "    property1: value1;\n",
    "    property2: value2;\n",
    "    /* more properties */\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Each declaration consists of a property and its corresponding value, separated by a colon `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. CSS Selectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Selectors are fundamental to CSS as they allow you to target specific HTML elements for styling. Here are some common types of selectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Element Selector**: Targets elements by their tag name.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  p {\n",
    "    font-size: 16px;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This selector targets all `<p>` elements and sets their font size to 16 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  .highlight {\n",
    "    background-color: yellow;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This selector targets all elements with the class \"highlight\" and gives them a yellow background color.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  #header {\n",
    "    font-size: 24px;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This selector targets the element with the ID \"header\" and sets its font size to 24 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descendant Selector**: Targets elements that are descendants of another element.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  div p {\n",
    "    font-style: italic;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This selector targets all `<p>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements and sets their font style to italic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Child Selector**: Targets elements that are direct children of another element.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  ul > li {\n",
    "    list-style-type: square;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This selector targets all `<li>` elements that are direct children of `<ul>` elements and sets their list style type to square.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. CSS Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS comments allow you to add explanatory notes within your stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-line Comments**: Begin with `//` and extend to the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  /* This is a single-line comment */\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-line Comments**: Enclosed within `/* */`, allowing comments to span multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```css\n",
    "  /*\n",
    "    This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "    It can span across multiple lines\n",
    "  */\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Comments are useful for documenting your CSS code, explaining complex styles, or temporarily disabling certain styles for testing purposes. They improve code readability and maintainability."
