    "## Comments\n",
    "HTML comments are text, phrases or sentences inside an HTML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are only shown in codes and not rendered by a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use HTML comments?\n",
    "HTML comments help both beginners and experienced web developers to easily organize their codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "They act like sticky notes in HTML files\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to write HTML comments\n",
    "An HTML comment starts with `<!--` and ends with `-->`. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- comments go here -->\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/dataidea/yfje0v27/3/embed/html,result/\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the example given above, you have learned that you make a single-line and multi-line of HTML comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you have noticed we have also put comments beside a start tag and end tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is for us to easily recognize where a specific element starts and ends."
